# CS5500_Group9_Blog-It-Web-Application

## A Full Stack Blog Web Application

## Introduction

Blog is a fully-functional personal website exactly like Facebook HomePage. And it is developed based on the classic MEVN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Vue and Node.JS).

## Front-end

We will use VUE.js to build our Front-end. 

--Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.

--Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.


## Back-end

We will use SpringBoot to build our Back-end.

--Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

--We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
